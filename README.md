NutScript Plugins Repository
=========

Here, you can find all of the plugins available for installation. They have been compressed into a .zip file, so you will need a program that can open .zip files such as 7-Zip or WinRAR.

Installation
=========
To install, just extract the contents of a .zip file into either:

1. The schema's plugin folder (e.g. gamemodes/sample/plugins)
      The folder may be created if it does not exist. Installing it to the schema's plugin folder will
      only affect that schema.
      
2. The NutScript plugin folder (gamemodes/nutscript/plugins)
      The folder should exist by default with some already default plugins. If a plugin is installed in
      the NutScript plugins folder, then ALL schemas will use the same plugin.
      
Submitting a Plugin
=========
To submit a plugin, simply make a pull request containing a compressed copy of your plugin. The contents of the .zip folder should be able to be installed by dragging it into a plugin directory. Make sure that your archived file also has a descriptive name, but it should not be too long or have spaces.
